"""Clamp Triton's unified-attention tiles so they fit Turing's 64 KiB per block.

THIS IS THE ONE THING THIS RIG HAS TO DO THAT ITS SIBLINGS DO NOT, and it is the
whole reason the rig exists. Read `docs/turing-shared-memory.md` before changing
anything here.

The problem, MEASURED on `gpu-vllm-g5g-2b` 2026-08-12 on the same Turing silicon:

    Gemma4 model has heterogeneous head dimensions
    {'sliding_attention': 256, 'full_attention': 512}. FA4 not available,
    forcing TRITON_ATTN.
    triton.runtime.errors.OutOfResources: shared memory,
    Required: 98304, Hardware limit: 65536

Gemma 4's global-attention layers are 512 wide, only FA4 or Triton handle
heterogeneous head dims, FA4 is unavailable, so vLLM FORCES Triton and the choice
is not overridable. Triton's tile at head_size=512 wants ~96 KiB per block and
Turing allows at most 64 KiB. There is no flag; the tiles have to come down.

VERIFIED AGAINST REAL UPSTREAM SOURCE 2026-08-29 (v0.28.0 and main, identical):
`_get_tile_size` has NO shared-memory awareness -- it returns 32/16/32 from
head_size and element size alone -- so upstream has not fixed this and the clamp
is still required.

WHY A SCRIPT AND NOT A BUILD, AND WHY NOT EVEN AN IMAGE. Three rigs now deliver
this same clamp three different ways, cheapest last:

  gpu-vllm-g5g-2b   aarch64: no SM 7.5 kernels published at all, so vLLM is
                    compiled from source (~67 min) and the patch rides along.
  gpu-vllm-g4dn-2b  x86_64 docker: the amd64 image already carries 7.5, so a
                    derived image is built `FROM` it with one COPY. Seconds.
  gpu-vllm-t4-2b    x86_64 pip, THIS RIG: there is no image. vLLM is installed
                    into the system python and the target is the installed
                    module in site-packages. Milliseconds.

THE CHEAPEST DELIVERY IS ALSO THE LEAST CONTAINED, and that is the one thing to
carry away. The EC2 siblings edit a file inside an image they built and throw
away; a bad patch costs a rebuild. Here the file is the host's own vLLM, shared
with every other process and every other rig on the box, and `pip install -U
vllm` silently reverts it. Re-run `verify_turing_patch` after ANY vLLM upgrade.

DESIGN RULE: FAIL LOUDLY, NEVER SILENTLY NO-OP. A patch that quietly matches
nothing -- or that lands in the wrong PLACE -- leaves an unpatched engine behind
a patched-looking tag, and the failure then surfaces ~10 minutes later as an
OutOfResources at engine start. Every anchor and identifier is checked, and a
miss is exit code 2 with the surrounding source attached.

WHERE THE CLAMP GOES IS AS IMPORTANT AS WHAT IT SAYS, and this is the subtle one.
Upstream reads the tile constants into a local well before the kernel launch:

    grid: tuple[Any, ...]
    if not use_3d:
        grid = (...); tile_size = TILE_SIZE_PREFILL     # <- consumed here
    else:
        grid = (...); tile_size = TILE_SIZE_DECODE      # <- and here
    launch_kwargs = {}
    if launch_num_stages is not None:
        launch_kwargs["num_stages"] = launch_num_stages # <- and here
    kernel_unified_attention[grid](...)                 # <- the launch

**Inserting at the launch site would clamp three variables nothing reads
afterwards.** The marker would be present, the in-image verification would pass,
`verify_triton_patch` would report success, and the kernel would still ask for
98,304 bytes. So the insertion point is derived from the code rather than from a
launch-site pattern: immediately after the LAST assignment to either tile
constant, with an explicit check that nothing READS them before that point.

Usage:
    patch_triton_turing.py PATH            # patch in place (idempotent)
    patch_triton_turing.py --check PATH    # 0 = patched, 1 = not patched

#
# THE IDEMPOTENCY CHECK KEYS ON `SENTINEL`, NOT ON `MARKER`, and on this rig that
# distinction is load-bearing where it was cosmetic on the EC2 siblings. They
# patch a file inside a throwaway docker image, one rig per image. Here the
# target is SYSTEM site-packages, shared by everything on the host — so a marker
# carrying only this rig's name would fail to recognise a clamp that a sibling
# script had already inserted, and the file would be patched TWICE: two `if
# capability < 8` blocks, the second halving the tiles again to 16 and reporting
# success. Match on the shared sentinel; record provenance in the marker.

#
# Detected through `ast`, NOT a regex, and the difference is load-bearing: the
# launch site reads `launch_kwargs["num_stages"] = launch_num_stages`, which a
# line-oriented pattern reads as an assignment to `num_stages`. It is a subscript
# store. Picking it would write `num_stages = 1` into the enclosing scope, where
# it binds a local nothing reads, and the clamp would then be HALF applied while
